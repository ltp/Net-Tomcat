=head1 NAME

Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard - Utility class for representing abstract 
Tomcat Connector scoreboard objects.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard object is an abstract collection of
L<Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard::Entry> objects.  This class exists
to provide higher level functions and syntactic sugar for accessing the
aforementioned objects.

        use Net::Tomcat;

        # Create a new Net::Tomcat object
        my $tc = Net::Tomcat->new(
                                username => 'admin',
                                password => 'password',
                                hostname => 'web-server-01.company.com'
                              ) 
                or die "Unable to create new Net::Tomcat object: $!\n";

        # Retrieve a Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard object by explicit
        # connector name
        my $sb = $tc->connector('http-8080')->scoreboard;

        # Extract or apply an interesting function to each of our
        # scoreboard threads (requests).
	my @threads_for_vhost = $sb->threads_for_vhost('myvhost');

	# Print out a graphical representation of the scoreboard.
	$sb->pretty_print;

	# Or, using the overloaded stringification
	print $sb;

=head1 METHODS

=head3 new

Constructor - creates a new Net::Tomcat::Connector::Statistics object.  Note 
that you should not normally need to call the constructor method directly as a 
Net::Tomcat::Connector::Statistics object will be created for you on invoking 
methods in parent classes.

=head3 threads

Returns an array of L<Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard::Entry> objects where
each object represents a thread currently being serviced by the connector.

=head3 thread_count

Returns the number of threads currently being services by the connector.

=head3 threads_ready

Returns the number of threads currently in a ready state.

=head3 threads_service

Returns the number of threads currently servicing a request.

=head3 threads_parse

Returns the number of threads currently in a parsing state.

=head3 threads_keepalive

Returns the number of threads currently in a keepalive state.

=head3 threads_finish

Returns the number of threads currently in a finish state.

=head3 threads_for_client ( $CLIENT )

	# Returns all threads for the client 10.80.8.8 on connector 'http-8080'
	my @threads = $tc->connector('http-8080')->scoreboard->threads_for_client( '10.80.8.8' );

Returns an array of L<Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard::Entry> objects where
each object represents a current thread servicing the client identified by the 
value of the $CLIENT parameter (usually an IP address).

=head3 threads_for_vhost ( $VHOST )
	
	# Return all threads for the virtual host 'www-4.company.com'
	my @threads = $tc->connector('http-8080')->scoreboard->threads_for_vhost( 'www-4.company.com' );

Returns an array of L<Net::Tomcat::Connector::Scoreboard::Entry> objects for
the virtual host (vhost) as defined by the value of the $VHOST parameter.

=head3 pretty_print

Prints an ascii representation of the scoreboard to standard out.

Note that this module also stringifies to this method.
